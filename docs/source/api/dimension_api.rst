Dimension
==============

Dimension defines the shape and structure of variables and stores 
coordinate data for multidimensional arrays. The ``Dimension`` object,
which is also a key component of ``File`` class, provides an interface
to access dimensions.

.. note:: 

   ``Dimension`` instances should be created using the :meth:`File.def_dim` method of a ``File`` instance,
   not using :meth:`Dimension.__init__` directly.
