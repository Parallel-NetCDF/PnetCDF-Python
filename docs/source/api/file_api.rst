``pnetcdf.File`` is a high-level object representing an netCDF file,
which provides a Pythonic interface to create, read and write within
an netCDF file. A File object serves as the root container for dimensions,
variables, and attributes. Together they describe the meaning of data and
relations among data fields stored in a netCDF file.

File Attributes
 The following class members are read-only and should not be modified by the user.

 .. attribute:: dimensions

    The dimensions dictionary maps the names of dimensions defined for the file 
    to instances of the ``pnetcdf.Dimension`` class. 

 .. attribute:: variables
      
    The variables dictionary maps the names of variables defined for this file 
    to instances of the ``pnetcdf.Variable`` class. 

 .. attribute:: file_format
    
    The file format in string of the netCDF file. Possible values include: "CLASSIC", "CDF2",
    "64BIT_OFFSET", "64BIT", "CDF5", "64BIT_DATA", "NETCDF4" and "BP".
